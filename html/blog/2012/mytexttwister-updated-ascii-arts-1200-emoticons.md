We are happy to bring <strong>version 1.3</strong> of <a title="MYTEXTTWISTER" href="http://kunruchcreations.com/mytexttwister/" target="_blank">MyTextTwister</a>. About two months back, we had announced the <a title="Seven new twisting logics in version 1.2 of MyTextTwister" href="http://kunruchcreations.com/twisting-logics-version1-2-mytexttwister/" target="_blank">version 1.2</a> of our app in which we had added 7 new twisting logics. This time we have included 1200+ emoticons (emojis) for your use along with new ASCII arts and also a new twisting logic. It took longer than expected for us to release the version 1.3 (due to multiple reasons), but we have finally done it. Along with updating the current FREE version of the app, we have also published a PAID version of the app <a title="MyTextTwister PRO" href="http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=4a5e84b9-6487-460a-b166-cce21492600e" target="_blank">MyTextTwister Pro</a> which will not contain any advertisements, and we recommend people to buy it and enjoy the app in its full glory!

Here's a summary of the exciting new additions that are available with this new version (1.3)

• <strong>1200+</strong> emoticons (emojis) added for using in your text

• new twisting logic: <strong>Faux Cyrillic</strong>

• new ASCII arts!

• app now remembers your last typed text and twisting logic

• copy to clipboard feature added

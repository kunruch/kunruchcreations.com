KunRuch Creations is a little over 2 months old now. Though the time it witnessed in the year 2011 is small, it's still worth-while to look back and reflect on what it achieved in the last year and decide the goals for the year ahead.

<em>Our first application</em>

On <strong>13<sup>th</sup> Oct, 2011</strong>, KunRuch Creation released its first application <a title="MyTileMaker" href="http://kunruchcreations.com/mytilemaker/" target="_blank">MyTileMaker</a> in Windows Phone Marketplace in all supported countries. The application was released free of cost, without any advertisements. Soon after, MyTileMaker saw a good response from users worldwide, and started receiving multiple reviews and feedbacks. Driven by the appreciation and incoming suggestions, we started to work on the next update of MyTileMaker. In about a month (<strong>18<sup>th</sup> Nov, 2011</strong>), we released version 2.0 of the application.

Updating our first application was not the only motivation that we got from our first release. We were so thrilled by the response of our first application at Windows Phone Marketplace, that we decided to launch another application as soon as possible. And in fact, we released our second application <a title="MyTextTwister" href="http://kunruchcreations.com/mytexttwister/" target="_blank">MyTextTwister</a> even before we finished developing the version 2.0 of MyTileMaker. MyTextTwister saw its first release on <strong>12<sup>th</sup> Nov, 2011</strong> and then a second update (version 1.1) on <strong>22<sup>nd</sup> Dec, 2011</strong>. Within a month only, MyTextTwister left behind our first application in the number of downloads and reviews and received reviews and mentions at numerous forums and websites.

<strong>Download numbers</strong>

We aggregated <strong>10,547</strong> total downloads for both the apps, during the period of 13<sup>th</sup> Oct, 2011 to 27<sup>th</sup> Dec, 2011 (<strong>76</strong> days). Individual download numbers can be found below.

The spike in Oct'11 is when we launched our first app MyTileMaker. Significant increase in download numbers happened in Nov'11, after the release of MyTextTwister. The second major spike is seen in Dec'11, which was an effect of MyTextTwister coming in limelight due to mentions by <a title="And 250,000 Impression Holiday Present Goes To …" href="http://blog.adduplex.com/2011/12/and-250000-impression-holiday-present.html" target="_blank">AdDuplex</a>, <a title="Add a twist to your messages with MyTextTwister" href="http://www.wpcentral.com/add-twist-your-messages-mytexttwister" target="_blank">wpcentral </a>and many other websites.

<strong>Reviews and Average Rating</strong>

MyTileMaker ended the year with an average rating of 4 out of 5 stars in all marketplaces with 41 reviews.

MyTextTwister witnessed 89 reviews across all regions and ended at an average of 4.5 stars.

MyTextTwister also saw the top 25 (top 10 in some marketplaces) social category apps from very close in almost all marketplace regions.

<strong>Summary and Looking ahead</strong>

Overall, we are pretty happy and proud of both of our applications. We are working on feature updates of both. In addition, we are also planning to release few new applications in the months to come, some of which are already under development, while some are still in conceptualization phase.

We absolutely adore the Windows Phone platform, and our application development for mobile platforms in the near future will be limited to it. Though we do hope to let out our creativity in other domains. :)

Once again, we wish everyone a very happy and glorious new year ahead!

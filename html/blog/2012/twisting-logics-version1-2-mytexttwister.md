We are happy to announce seven new twisting logics in version 1.2 of <strong>MyTextTwister. </strong>What's more, there's a whole new category (exclamations) of ASCII art added. Along with these, many new ASCII arts have been added in all the earlier categories as well.

Here's a glimpse of what can be achieved with two of the new twisting logics:
<pre>Ⓣɣpe ץoúř †ⓔ×† iȠ mⓘ×ℯ∂ modℯ....</pre>
<pre>ᴼʳ ᵗʸᵖᵉ ˢᵐᵃˡˡ ᵗᵉˣᵗ</pre>
And some of the new ASCII arts:

It gives us great pleasure to announce that our apps have made it to the final rounds of <a href="http://appawards.wp7applist.com" target="_blank">2012 Community App awards</a> which is being hosted by <a href="http://wp7applist.com" target="_blank">wp7applist.com</a>.

As a result, our apps <a title="MYTEXTTWISTER" href="http://kunruchcreations.com/mytexttwister/" target="_blank">MyTextTwister</a> and <a title="MYTILEMAKER" href="http://kunruchcreations.com/mytilemaker/" target="_blank">MyTileMaker</a> have reached into the top 10 finalist apps in 5 categories (including <strong>App of the Year</strong> and <strong>Best Free app</strong>), which for us is an achievement in itself. It is really wonderful that our users find these apps worthy of such great titles.

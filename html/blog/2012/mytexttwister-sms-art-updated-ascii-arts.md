The apps were updated few days back and we had updated our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/kunruchcreations" target="_blank">facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/kunruch" target="_blank">twitter</a> followers about this, but we delayed the public announcement on our website as the Windows Phone marketplace was experiencing some issues</a> with app updates. Microsoft has resolved it now and users would be able to update the apps successfully. In case you don’t see an update in your marketplace then kindly click on one of the following links (based on the app you have) from your windows phone to visit them in marketplace and get the update.

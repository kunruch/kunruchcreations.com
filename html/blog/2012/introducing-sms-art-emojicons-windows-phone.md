These applications are simplified versions of the features offered by our popular text fun app <a title="MYTEXTTWISTER" href="https://kunruchcreations.com/mytexttwister/" target="_blank">MyTextTwister</a>, which has been around for a while in Marketplace and has gathered around 62,000+ downloads worldwide as of now. Along with a free ad-supported version, these new apps also offer a PRO version (paid) which is available without any ads.

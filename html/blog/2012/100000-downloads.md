It may have taken us 7 months to reach to the first <a title="Achievement Unlocked! 50,000 downloads" href="http://kunruchcreations.com/achievement-unlocked-50000-downloads/" target="_blank">50,000 downloads</a>, but the next 50,000 came in just 2 months. We started our journey on 13th Oct 2011 for Windows Phone Platform and have proudly published 8 apps (4 free and 4 paid) till now. Our users have rated all our apps with 4+ stars on an average :) Thank you all for your nice comments and appreciations in the reviews and for all the great feedback!

Here is a peak at some of the stats <em>(as of 8th July, 2012)</em>

Most of the spikes in the daily downloads count is the effect of our apps getting featured in various marketplaces.

It's interesting to note that downloads in <strong>India</strong> has now taken over the downloads in UK market with a good margin since the <a title="Achievement Unlocked! 50,000 downloads" href="http://kunruchcreations.com/achievement-unlocked-50000-downloads/">last time we published our stats</a>, while US continues to be the #1 market.

We have very exciting updates planned for all our apps and we are committed to keep our users happy.  Do let your suggestions and feedback coming. Thank You! :)

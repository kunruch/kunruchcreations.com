We have updated <a href="http://apps.kunruchcreations.com/smsart/" target="_blank">SMS Art</a> with a fresh look that brings a new, colorful user interface for you. Now each category of ASCII arts follows the color theme of its category tile, so while navigating through these text arts you can easily identify the category that you are currently browsing. Along with this colorful interface, we have made it easy for you to recognize the selected ASCII text art. You can see a glimpse of this new interface in the above image.

This update also has new ASCII text arts in store for you. With holiday season around the corner, don't forget to use the text arts offered by SMS Art to make your greetings more special and personal.

With this update, we have also added support for all three tile sizes (small, medium and wide), if you are a WP7.8 or WP8 user, you can now pin a wide tile of SMS Art on your home screen.

We hope that you will find these changes useful and enjoy the selection of new text arts :). Do let us know what you think of the brand new look by leaving your rating in the store.
